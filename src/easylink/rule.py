Snakemake Rules
===============

We have chosen to use `Snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ 
as the EasyLink workflow manager. This module is responsible for generating the 
Snakemake rules to be run as well as writing them to the Snakefile.

Note we have adopted the Snakemake term "rule" to refer to a singular component 
in a Snakefile (i.e. in a Snakemake pipeline) that defines input files, output files,
and the command to run to create those output files. These rules are generated
dynamically as strings and appended to the Snakefile.
