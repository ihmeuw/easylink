Pipeline Schema
===============

Motivation
----------

Imagine the Census Bureau has an entity resolution pipeline that links people between datasets.
One step in this pipeline, called *blocking*, rules out comparing certain records with each other
in order to focus only on the pairs of records that might really be links.
The current pipeline uses a simple blocking mechanism,
which won't compare two records unless they match exactly on any of a few key attributes.
Census wants to explore whether using more sophisticated blocking methods would improve results,
without changing anything else in the pipeline.

Currently, software for entity resolution is mostly created by researchers.
Each researcher uses the technologies familiar to them and frames the entity resolution task
in the way that is most natural for their own examples,
making it hard to use multiple software modules together.
As a result, trying a new blocking method is too expensive for the Census Bureau
to undertake without knowing what the benefit will be.

Introduction
------------

**EasyLink** is a tool for creating entity resolution pipelines
by chaining together existing pieces of software.

It doesn't allow making pipelines arbitrarily by chaining together whatever software you want however you want,
and this is actually the key value proposition of EasyLink.
To be used in pipelines created with EasyLink, software modules must follow standard patterns.
These standards (including standard data formats) allow a single piece of software
to be used for the same conceptual task in any entity resolution pipeline.

We define our standards via the *pipeline schema*, which is described on this page.
The design goals of the pipeline schema are to be:

- **Flexible** enough to capture current entity resolution methods and new methods that are yet to be developed.
  In particular, we want to avoid a small innovation in one part of a pipeline causing that entire pipeline
  to become impossible to construct with EasyLinkâ€”*"bend, don't break."*
- **Detailed/standardized** enough in capturing current entity resolution methods,
  and areas of active methodological research, to allow very fine-grained experiments and interoperability.

Our pipeline schema can also be viewed as a restricted (but still very large) space of possible pipelines.
That is, there are certain pipelines EasyLink does not allow because they do not conform to our standards,
and the pipeline schema tells EasyLink how to check whether a pipeline is or isn't allowed.
