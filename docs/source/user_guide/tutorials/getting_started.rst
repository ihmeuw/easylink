Introduction
============
EasyLink is a framework that allows users to build and run highly configurable record linkage pipelines. 
Its configurability enables users to "mix and match" different pieces of record 
linkage software by ensuring that each piece of the pipeline conforms to standard patterns. 

For example, users at the Census Bureau could easily evaluate whether using a more sophisticated "blocking" 
method would improve results in a certain pipeline, without having to rewrite the entire pipeline. For more 
information, read about the `motivation <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#motivation>`_
behind EasyLink.

Overview
--------
This tutorial introduces EasyLink concepts and features by demonstrating the software's usage. Covered 
concepts include the EasyLink record linkage "pipeline schema," EasyLink pipeline configuration, running 
pipelines, changing record linkage step implementations, changing input data, evaluating and comparing 
results, and more.

Audience
--------
This tutorial is intended for people familiar with record linkage practices, who are interested
in easily comparing linkage results across different methods. This tutorial will *not* cover information 
about linkage techniques or software and assumes the reader is familiar with these concepts and 
ready to implement that knowledge using EasyLink.

Tutorial prerequisites
----------------------
`Install EasyLink <https://github.com/ihmeuw/easylink?tab=readme-ov-file#installation>`_ if you haven't already. 

The tutorial uses the `Splink <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/index.html>`_ Python package 
for record linkage implementations. You do **not** need to install Splink. Splink knowledge is not 
required to complete the tutorial but may be helpful when configuring Splink models.


Simulated input data
--------------------
Our first demonstration of running an EasyLink pipeline will configure a simple, "naive" record linkage
model using Splink implementations. Our pipeline will link
two simulated datasets generated by our `pseudopeople <https://pseudopeople.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
package: simulated `Social Security Administration records <https://pseudopeople.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/index.html#social-security-administration>`_
and simulated `W-2 and 1099 employment tax forms <https://pseudopeople.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/index.html#tax-forms-w-2-1099>`_.
These datasets are about entirely simulated people, who we call "simulants,"
but they contain realistic data, including "noise" such as typos,
for an authentic record linkage challenge.


Naive model - running a pipeline
================================
Let's start by using the ``easylink run`` :ref:`command <cli>` to run a pipeline that configures a simple 
record linkage model.

First we need to download the configuration files we will pass to the command: 
:download:`environment_local.yaml <environment_local.yaml>`, 
:download:`input_data_demo.yaml`, and :download:`pipeline_demo_naive.yaml`. Save them into the directory
from which you will execute the ``easylink run`` command. 

``input_data_demo.yaml`` additionally references a few 
input files which we will save as well. Save :download:`known_clusters.parquet` to the same directory as
the other files, then create a subdirectory called ``2020`` and save :download:`input_file_ssa.parquet <2020/input_file_ssa.parquet>` and 
:download:`input_file_w2.parquet <2020/input_file_w2.parquet>` into it.

Now we can run the pipeline. Note that if this is your first time running EasyLink, the command will first
download the required `Singularity <https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/introduction.html>`_
container images. These files contain the code EasyLink will run for each step in the record linkage 
pipeline. The total amount to be downloaded is approximately 5GB, so we recommend first running the command 
below, then reading the information about it while the files download. Hopefully the download will be 
complete by the time you reach the next interactive section! The progress of your image downloads will be 
displayed in the console.

Success! Our pipeline has linked the input data and outputted the results, the clusters of records it found. We'll take a look 
at these results later and see how the model performed. But first we will explore each of the arguments we 
passed to the command.

.. note:: 
   The pipeline output in its current state can be a little confusing. Note that the number assigned 
   to the slurm jobs is different than the order the jobs are executed in - these job IDs are 
   assigned by `Snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, a workflow manager
   that EasyLink uses to run your linkage pipeline. Also note that several input validation jobs will run before any actual 
   step implementations.

   Finally, despite the final output line containing the phrase "Missing output files", 
   this pipeline finished executing successfully. The "Reason" displayed in the output is explaining 
   why the job was run (the step inputs were ready but the output file did not yet exist), rather than 
   conveying an error message. We plan to improve these terminal outputs in the future.

Naive model - command line arguments
====================================

Computing Environment
---------------------
The ``--computing-environment`` (``-e``) argument to ``easylink run`` accepts a YAML file specifying 
information about the computing environment which will execute the steps of the 
pipeline. We passed ``environment_local.yaml``, the contents of which are shown below::

   computing_environment: local
   container_engine: singularity

It specifies a ``local`` computing environment using ``singularity`` as the container engine. These parameters indicate that no new compute resources will 
be used to execute the pipeline steps, and that the Singularity container for each implementation will run within the context where ``easylink run`` is being executed.
For example, if you ran the ``easylink run`` command on your laptop, the implementations would run on your laptop;
if you ran the ``easylink run`` command on a cloud (e.g. EC2) instance that you were connected to with SSH, the implementations would run on that instance,
and so on.

Input data
----------
The ``--input-data`` (``-i``) argument to ``easylink run`` accepts a YAML file specifying a list 
of paths to files or directories containing input data to be used by the pipeline. 
We passed ``input_data_demo.yaml``, the contents of which are shown below::

  input_file_ssa: 2020/input_file_ssa.parquet
  input_file_w2: 2020/input_file_w2.parquet
  known_clusters: known_clusters.parquet

Here we have defined the locations of the three input files we will use: the 2020 versions of the 
two pseudopeople datasets, and an empty ``known_clusters`` file, since no
clusters are known to us before running this pipeline. 

.. note::
    To meet the input specifications for :ref:`datasets` defined by the pipeline schema (see the next section),
    the SSA and W2 datasets, after being generated by pseudopeople, were modified
    to add the required ``Record ID`` column. SSA death records were also removed, 
    leaving only SSN creation records.
  

Pipeline specification
----------------------
The ``--pipeline-specification`` (``-p``) argument to ``easylink run`` accepts a YAML file specifying 
the implementations and other configuration options for the pipeline being run. We passed 
``pipeline_demo_naive.yaml``, the contents of which can be seen by clicking below:

  </details>

The pipeline specification follows the structure defined in the :ref:`pipeline_schema`, a very important
part of EasyLink. The EasyLink pipeline schema defines the steps of the record linkage pipeline, the inputs and outputs for each step, and the required formats for 
each input or output data file.
These standard patterns, which implementations of each step in the linkage process must follow,
enable easy configuration and swapping.

There are some flexible sections in the pipeline schema, such as :ref:`cloneable sections <cloneable_sections>`, which allow a pipeline to create multiple copies of that section and use different 
implementations or inputs for each copy. We'll see one of those soon.

.. important::

  Before proceeding, it's important to understand the relationship between a pipeline, a pipeline 
  specification (YAML file), and the pipeline schema:

  - A `pipeline <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#pipelines>`_ 
    consists of a complete set of software which can perform a whole record linkage task, taking in record datasets as inputs and outputting 
    a result such as clusters of records or some analysis on those clusters. EasyLink makes it simple to define and run 
    many different pipelines in order to experiment with what methods yield the best results for a task.
  - A pipeline specification is a YAML file, which defines a pipeline which can be run with EasyLink. It defines the 
    implementation which will be run for each step, and performs any necessary configuration for those implementations. An 
    example specification is expandable above.
  - The EasyLink :ref:`pipeline_schema` defines the universe of pipelines that can be constructed using EasyLink, including
    steps, inputs and outputs, and operators, as described above. All pipelines must adhere to the pipeline schema and implement all its steps! 

Top-level steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's take a closer look at the pipeline specification YAML bit by bit. We'll start at the top level::

  steps:
    entity_resolution:
      substeps:
        ...
    canonicalizing_and_downstream_analysis:
      implementation:
        name: save_clusters

This code block shows the same file, but with all the substeps of ``entity_resolution`` hidden, 
like in `this diagram <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#easylink-pipeline-schema>`__
of the pipeline schema. 

The children of the ``steps`` key are the top-level steps in the pipeline - as you can see, there are 
only two. We can see our first example of a step being configured if we look at ``canonicalizing_and_downstream_analysis``. 
The children of the ``implementation`` key define and configure the code we will run for 
`the canonicalizing and downstream analysis step <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#canonicalizing-and-downstream-analysis>`_.
This step is intended to be used for determining best representative ("canonical") records for each cluster, and/or
doing some kind of summary data analysis (such as a linear regression) within EasyLink.
In this case, we won't do either of these things, and simply save the resolved clusters with no additional processing.
We use the ``name`` key to choose the ``save_clusters`` implementation of ``canonicalization_and_downstream_analysis``.
``save_clusters`` corresponds to one of the images which was downloaded the first time you ran the pipeline.

Entity resolution substeps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we will show the ellipsed part of the above code block, which corresponds to 
`this diagram <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#entity-resolution-sub-steps>`__
in the pipeline schema::

  determining_exclusions_and_removing_records:
    clones:
      - determining_exclusions:
          implementation:
            name: default_determining_exclusions
            configuration:
              INPUT_DATASET: input_file_ssa
        removing_records:
          implementation:
            name: default_removing_records
            configuration:
              INPUT_DATASET: input_file_ssa
      - determining_exclusions:
          implementation:
            name: default_determining_exclusions
            configuration:
              INPUT_DATASET: input_file_w2
        removing_records:
          implementation:
            name: default_removing_records
            configuration:
              INPUT_DATASET: input_file_w2
  clustering:
    substeps:
      ...
  updating_clusters:
    implementation:
      name: default_updating_clusters

The last step shown, ``updating_clusters``, looks similar to ``canonicalization_and_downstream_analysis`` above; it simply chooses 
an implementation for the step using the ``name`` key. 

The substeps of ``clustering`` are hidden -- we'll look at them next. 

The complicated part is ``determining_exclusions_and_removing_records`` and its ``clones`` key:

The schema can define :ref:`cloneable sections <cloneable_sections>`, which allow a pipeline to create 
multiple copies of that section and use different implementations or inputs
for each copy. We can see that the :ref:`entity resolution sub-steps <entity_resolution_sub_steps>` schema section defines
``determining_exclusions`` and ``removing_records`` as cloneable in the diagram 
(blue dashed box).

In the YAML, the cloneable superstep ``determining_exclusions_and_removing_records`` is expanded 
using the ``clones`` key, and two copies are made of its substeps, 
``determining_exclusions`` and ``removing_records``. The ``-`` denotes the beginning
of each of the two copies, each of which must contain both of the substeps. 

We can see that the only difference between the two copies is what filename is passed 
to the ``INPUT_DATASET`` configuration key for each step. In 
the first copy, the ``ssa`` dataset files are used as inputs for both steps, 
while in the second copy, the ``w2`` dataset files are the inputs. In practice, 
this means that records to exclude will be identified and removed separately for 
each input file, as required by the schema since each input file has different data. 
This cloneable section also allows different implementations to be used for each dataset 
if desired.

.. note::
  All the steps listed here use ``default`` implementations.
  Much of the time, steps with default implementations aren't very interesting to change,
  and the defaults will do whatever operation is the common or simple case.
  The pipeline schema section linked above the code block describes the behavior 
  of each of these default implementations.

Clustering substeps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we will show the ellipsed part of the above code block, which corresponds to 
`this diagram <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#clustering-sub-steps>`__
in the pipeline schema::

  clusters_to_links:
    implementation:
      name: default_clusters_to_links
  linking:
    substeps:
      ...
  links_to_clusters:
    implementation:
      name: splink_links_to_clusters
      configuration:
        THRESHOLD_MATCH_PROBABILITY: 0.996

We will show the hidden linking substeps in the next section. 

In ``links_to_clusters`` we see a more interesting example of configuring an implementation.
``THRESHOLD_MATCH_PROBABILITY`` here allows the user to define at what probability a pair of records 
will be considered part of the same cluster by ``splink_links_to_clusters``, which uses the Splink package to 
implement the ``links_to_clusters`` `step <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#links-to-clusters>`_.
The Splink docs have
`more info <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/topic_guides/evaluation/edge_overview.html#choosing-a-threshold>`__ on
what the threshold means and how to choose it.

Linking substeps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we will show the ellipsed part of the above code block, which corresponds to 
`this diagram <https://easylink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/pipeline_schema/index.html#linking-sub-steps>`__
in the pipeline schema::

  pre-processing:
    clones:
    - implementation:
        name: middle_name_to_initial
        configuration: 
          INPUT_DATASET: input_file_ssa
    - implementation:
        name: no_pre-processing
        configuration: 
          INPUT_DATASET: input_file_w2
  schema_alignment:
    implementation:
      name: default_schema_alignment
  blocking_and_filtering:
    implementation:
      name: splink_blocking_and_filtering
      configuration:
        LINK_ONLY: true
        BLOCKING_RULES: "l.first_name == r.first_name,l.last_name == r.last_name"
  evaluating_pairs:
    implementation:
      name: splink_evaluating_pairs
      configuration:
        LINK_ONLY: true
        BLOCKING_RULES_FOR_TRAINING: "l.first_name == r.first_name,l.last_name == r.last_name"
        COMPARISONS: "ssn:exact,first_name:exact,middle_initial:exact,last_name:exact"
        PROBABILITY_TWO_RANDOM_RECORDS_MATCH: 0.0001  # == 1 / len(w2)

We see that ``pre-processing`` is another cloneable step, allowing us to select different pre-processing implementations for different
input datasets. In this case, we leave the ``w2`` dataset unchanged, while changing the ``middle_name`` column in the ``ssa`` dataset 
to a ``middle_initial`` column to match the ``w2`` data.

Finally, we will configure the two Splink implementations.

For ``splink_blocking_and_filtering``, we set::

    LINK_ONLY: true
    BLOCKING_RULES: "l.first_name == r.first_name,l.last_name == r.last_name"

The first variable instructs Splink to link records between datasets without de-depulicating within 
datasets.
The second is used by the Splink implementation to define which pairs of records 
will be considered as possible matches (only records with matching first or last names).

For ``splink_evaluating_pairs``, we set::

  LINK_ONLY: true
  BLOCKING_RULES_FOR_TRAINING: "l.first_name == r.first_name,l.last_name == r.last_name"
  COMPARISONS: "ssn:exact,first_name:exact,middle_initial:exact,last_name:exact"
  PROBABILITY_TWO_RANDOM_RECORDS_MATCH: 0.0001  # == 1 / len(w2)

The first two variables are used similarly to the previous implementation.
``BLOCKING_RULES_FOR_TRAINING`` is specifically used for `estimating parameters in the model <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/tutorials/04_Estimating_model_parameters.html#estimating-with-expectation-maximisation>`_.
``COMPARISONS``
defines the columns which will be compared by the Splink model, and how Splink will evaluate
whether the column values match (exact comparisons). The fourth is a parameter used in training
the model and making predictions
(`see the Splink docs for more info <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/tutorials/04_Estimating_model_parameters.html#estimation-of-probability_two_random_records_match>`__). 


And that's the whole pipeline specification for our naive Splink model! Next let's take a look at the results from when we ran the 
pipeline earlier.

Naive model - results

Input and output data is stored in Parquet files. For example, to see our original records, 
we can view the contents of the input files listed in ``input_data_demo.yaml`` using Python:

It can also be useful to set up an alias to more easily preview parquet files.
Run the following line to do so.
(If you want this alias to persist across terminal restarts, you can add it to your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_aliases`` in your home directory.)

.. code-block:: console

   pqprint() { python -c "import pandas as pd; print(pd.read_parquet('$1'))" ; }

Let's use the alias to print the results parquet, the location of which was printed when we ran the pipeline.

.. code-block:: console

As we can see, the pipeline has successfully outputted a ``Cluster ID`` for every 
input record it was able to link to another record for our probability threshold 
of 99.6%. ``Cluster ID`` names are chosen by Splink based on the first record 
assigned to them.

.. note::

  Running the pipeline also generates a :download:`DAG.svg <DAG-naive-pipeline.svg>` file in 
  the results directory which shows the implementations, data dependencies and 
  input validations present in the pipeline. Due to the large number of steps, the figure is 
  not very readable when embedded in this page, but can be opened in a new tab to allow for
  zooming in.

To see how the model linked pairs of records before resolving them into clusters, we can 
look at the intermediate output produced by the ``splink_evaluating_pairs`` 
implementation::

  $ pqprint results/2025_06_26_10_13_31/intermediate/splink_evaluating_pairs/result.parquet

The record pairs displayed in the preview are all far below the match threshold, but the full results could 
be investigated further using ``pandas.read_parquet()`` in a Python session.

The Splink implementations in our pipeline also produce some diagnostic charts which can be useful 
for evaluating results, such as the :download:`match weights chart <naive_match_weights.html>` 
(`Splink docs <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/charts/match_weights_chart.html>`__) and 
:download:`comparison viewer tool <naive_comparison_viewer.html>` 
(`Splink docs <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/charts/comparison_viewer_dashboard.html>`__). 
These charts are from the 
``diagnostics/splink_evaluating_pairs`` subdirectory of the results directory for each pipeline run.

Finally, since we are using simulated input datasets, and therefore know the ground truth of 
which records are truly links, we can directly see how our naive model performed with the help of 
a script to evaluate false positives and false negatives, :download:`print_fp_fn_w2_ssa.py`.
Download and run it::

  $ python print_fp_fn_w2_ssa.py results/2025_06_26_10_13_31 .996
  9292 true links
  For threshold 0.996, len(false_positives)=19; len(false_negatives)=188

In other words, with a threshold 
probability of 99.6%, out of 9,292 true links to be found, our model missed 188 (false negatives),
and additionally linked 19 pairs that shouldn't have been linked (false positives). 


Depending on our goals with the linked data, we might increase the threshold to reduce false positives,
at the cost of increased false negatives.
But this was a simple linkage model.
Let's improve it to see if we can get a better performance tradeoff!


Configuring an improved pipeline
================================
Next, let's modify our naive pipeline configuration YAML to try to improve our results. Primarily, we 
will change the ``COMPARISONS`` we pass to ``splink_evaluating_pairs`` to use flexible comparison 
methods rather than exact matches, allowing us to link records which have typos or other noise in them. We'll 
use a new pipeline configuration YAML, :download:`pipeline_demo_improved.yaml`, with these changes.

In ``splink_evaluating_pairs``, we make the following change:

.. code-block:: diff

     LINK_ONLY: true
     BLOCKING_RULES_FOR_TRAINING: "'l.first_name == r.first_name,l.last_name == r.last_name'"
  -  COMPARISONS: "ssn:exact,first_name:exact,middle_initial:exact,last_name:exact"
  +  COMPARISONS: "ssn:levenshtein,first_name:name,middle_initial:exact,last_name:name"
     PROBABILITY_TWO_RANDOM_RECORDS_MATCH: 0.0001  # == 1 / len(w2)



``COMPARISONS`` now uses 
`Levenshtein <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/api_docs/comparison_library.html#splink.comparison_library.LevenshteinAtThresholds>`_
comparisons for ``ssn``, and 
`Name <https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/api_docs/comparison_library.html#splink.comparison_library.NameComparison>`_
comparisons for ``first_name`` and ``last_name``, to link similar but not identical SSNs and names.

By re-running the pipeline with these changes and then running the evauation script, we can see how our results compare::

  $ easylink run -p pipeline_demo_improved.yaml -i input_data_demo.yaml -e environment_local.yaml -I /mnt/team/simulation_science/priv/engineering/er_ecosystem/images
  $ python print_fp_fn_w2_ssa.py results/2025_06_26_11_08_57 .996
  9292 true links
  For threshold 0.996, len(false_positives)=19; len(false_negatives)=158

We eliminated 30 false negatives compared to the naive results, thanks to our model linking more records with columns that 
are similar but don't exactly match.

Linking 2030 datasets using improved pipeline
=============================================
Finally, let's run this same "improved" pipeline, but using :download:`input_data_demo_2030.yaml` 
as the input YAML, which uses the SSA and W-2 datasets from 2030 rather than 
2020. Like we did for 2020, we'll create a ``2030`` directory and save :download:`input_file_ssa.parquet <2030/input_file_ssa.parquet>` and 
:download:`input_file_w2.parquet <2030/input_file_w2.parquet>` into it.

We can run the same pipeline on different data by changing only the input parameter::

  $ easylink run -p pipeline_demo_improved.yaml -i input_data_demo_2030.yaml -e environment_local.yaml -I /mnt/team/simulation_science/priv/engineering/er_ecosystem/images
  python print_fp_fn_w2_ssa.py results/2025_06_26_11_17_52 .996
  10345 true links
  For threshold 0.996, len(false_positives)=14; len(false_negatives)=149

We get similar, but not identical, results with the 2030 data.
